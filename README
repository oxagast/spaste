A pure perl SSL encrypted port of https://github.com/solusipse/fiche termbin.com in perl.

Install: `echo "alias sp='openssl s_client -verify_return_error -servername spaste.oxasploits.com -quiet -connect spaste.oxasploits.com:8888 2>/dev/null'" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc`

Useage: `echo "yes hello" | sp`

Notes: This also works with ncat from the nmap package if you have that installed but for some odd reason not openssl.

Thanks to brianx for finding a bug in the openssl version where certs were not being verified, and the wrong cert was being served up, thus MITM was possible.  Since it has been fixed.
